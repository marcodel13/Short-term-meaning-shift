TARGET WORD: vomit

*2011-13*
> the Spuds Again with the trying to make me vomit
Anyone else just vomit all over their keyboard?
All the top comments were like, "I am not a football fan but I even hate this guy", or "why isn 't someone punching him in his face" makes me want to vomit
Unless you're literally an American who was raised in Liverpool, your name makes me want to vomit.
That was vomit inducing

*2017*
 I want to vomit.... Thanks. I need to watch Emres goal 10 times to get better.
So worst case scenario for us is 5th place while United wins against Ajax? Oh god. I think i'm going to vomit.
Klopp acknowledged we failed and said he wanted to vomit after the goal
[insert vomit gif]
God damn scholes sounds like hes choking down vomit whenever he talks.

**************

TARGET WORD: crew

*2011-13*
Besides, Fergie would never allow an all-acces crew in to the club
Now that my Columbus Crew keep signing Argentines, I say leave Argentina alone! ;)
I know CL would be a big upper for Hazard but a can see him getting wooed by King K and the crew
Now he can have the fight with the captain and his crew, I say bring it mr afro!
I remember watching their midfielder Lucas doing an interview for Sport TV in Brazil and he was showing a camera crew around

*2017*
And Tony Soprano's crew of guineas!
Fuck YOU Michael Oliver and crew...
He is one of the "fake taxi" crew member and only says such things to get laid 😢
With only four weeks of the season left that session was an end to my season or continuing on in a decent crew boat otherwise I'm going to be racing champs in a scratch crew
Glen Messi Johnson was a popular one for my crew and I... anyone else?

**************

TARGET WORD: erect

*2011-13*
Starkly erect!
Well, I am fully erect now.
>the circle jerk is in full effect The circle jerk is fully erect Couldn't help myself.
Stop! My penis can only get so erect...

*2017*
Well, I'm erect.
I can only be so erect especially if we get Salah too
please sign someone...I am gone insane It's like I am in a loop...a perfect loop every new post here seems the same as the one last week and the week before I have started to F5 in sleep I see keita in ma dream I wake up in the morning with full erect djik I am not sure if the laptop is on or not..
I can only get so erect 
Stop, I can only get so erect.

**************

TARGET WORD: millionaires

*2011-13*
It's a bit galling to watch a bunch of 20-something year old millionaires not even look like they care (i'm looking at you here Downing) so I think it is completely understandable to criticize the players
Ftfy Our millionaire culture here has a subset known as "50 cent millionaires" that see credit in their name as a right instead of a responsibility
But please don't rationalize shit with multi-millionaires/best doctors
These guys are multi-multi millionaires
I mean, these last few years were horrible, mediocre expensive players came, and the young hungry talented players didn't have a chance to compete with these millionaires

*2017*
we better get that win on sunday, cant have these millionaires ruining my holiday.
These people are millionaires but can't figure out not to drive when they party hardy
In Summerlin you get the high-end millionaires who have golf-courses upon their own oasis
ALL millionaires
As if some random post on a fucking Reddit forum is going to have any influence a football game played by a bunch of millionaires

**************

TARGET WORD: toxic

*2011-13*
Sometimes the ones offering higher wages have a toxic work environment, are run by douche bags or employ people you can't see yourself getting along with
No secret that Suarez is a toxic asset
God only knows why they were dumb enough to hire him in the first place. The man is toxic and will always be.
Because any position that Kenny is in for LFC that is not the manager is a toxic position
Specially now with How toxic his situation might b in liverpool i think more Bids WILL come :/ 

*2017*
hope he scores at the etihad on sunday. mostly so i can see if thebackseatman buys a randall toxic shirt.
Pogba got the Toxic Thunder on his head. Respect. 
Which is funny because our match day threads are toxic as fuck if we haven't scored two by the thirty second mark
If we somehow win this I will buy that god awful toxic kit with whoever scores the winner on the back of it.
We always win in the Toxic Thunder

**************

TARGET WORD: seeded

*2011-13*
Liverpool would be in the third basket of teams, so you would have your work cut out to finish ahead of two better seeded sides than you
The draft is seeded so that the worst team gets to pick first in each round, then second worst goes second..
Danny, Hulk, Lombaerts, Witsel, Alves, Criscito are already six who are seeded
Second leg is at home as we were seeded.
They need the depth though, they can probably get out of CL group stages because they are quite well seeded

*2017*
They aren't. They will be seeded if they go through. If not, they will be replaced by to other seeded teams
CSKA 4-0 up btw guys, secure 4th and we're seeded in the play-offs
Obviously 4th is better than no CL football, but getting 3rd and being seeded is no doubt a much better possibility for us
Liverpool will now be seeded for CL qualifier draw - Who should we fear?
I think we'll probably be seeded along with those teams, it depends how the previous qualifying round goes but that run to the EL final last year might do us a solid.


**************

TARGET WORD: village

*2011-13*
I think Toronto is a village outside of Bristol.
A friend of mine has been over and seen the village, more like a town, they are building at the moment
Funny thing is if I see babies and toddlers walking around the village wearing united jerseys I get slightly angry and feel like it's a form of child abuse.
For example, Westboro/Wellington Village, Civic Hospital/Experimental Farm, Little Italy, and the southern part of Centretown are all pretty close to the 101
Meireles looks like he should be pillaging and raping a village somewhere, what a beast

*2017*
Because [Hoffenheim is a small village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoffenheim)
Thanks to that shitty, "village" comment, we might actually get him.
>If Keita was from France he wouldn't have said village Exactly......so how is that racist? It's not like he's saying all black people live in mud and grass huts. 
Unless you're changing his skin color he would still be a black guy, Ragnick wouldn't have said village, and you wouldn't be calling him a racist
hoffenheim is a village with a couple of 1000 people, they just were lucky that one of them is the founder of SAP who got rich as hell and put his money into the tsg

**************

TARGET WORD: dank 

*2011-13*
That shit is dank.

*2017*
Absolute baller and he is also quite dank
This sub was in need of some dank memes.
The great dank meme addiction of 13/14.
Do they have a Huge Hog providing illegally high purity levels of fresh dank?
Quick, redeem yourself with some dank owl memes!

**************

TARGET WORD: accomplish

*2011-13*
Yes, the last two results were hardly ideal, but we're still in a solid position to accomplish what I think most deemed our major goal of this year - qualify for the CL
and if we do what does it accomplish
Pretty sure you can get option files that accomplish the same thing for consoles.
He's played a certain way his whole life and changing your game all of a sudden is a difficult thing to accomplish
I'm pretty sure that winning the Carling Cup isn't too high on Chelsea's list of things to accomplish this season, so they probably wont field too strong of a team

*2017*
also, I understand Coutinho wants to be a legend and playing for Barcelona is a great way to accomplish that, but after all these years, wouldn 't winning at Liverpool and being "the guy," at the squad that finally won the league mean more than just being another guy who won it all at Barcelona
Quite sad that is. I hope we accomplish something this season
Maybe they saw the last two weeks -- Liverpool defeat Hoffenheim away which no team in the Bundesliga, including Bayern and Dortmund, could accomplish last season, and then dismantled both Hoffenheim and Arsenal at Anfield
I can't believe that Klopp must tell Origi to drift to the wings, I never see him accomplish anything except cut off his options and then win a throw
Just go and make yourself better, strive to accomplish something each day

**************

TARGET WORD: unclench

*2011-13*
I can finally unclench my asshole

*2017*
AND UNCLENCH!
Football is back lads. Now let's wait for the window to shut close so we can unclench and reclench as we win the league.
when the camera panned over to rushie, i thought i saw him visibly unclench in his chair.
Everyone needs to take a deep breath, unclench for a bit and enjoy the loosness before the end of the window/beginning if the season.
And... unclench. 

**************

TARGET WORD: voice

*2011-13*
Travelling Kop in good voice today!
Im going to be the voice of dissent but every friggen thing that comes out of this guys mouth sounds like whining. Please stop talking about Liverpool, guy.
Yep. Inside voice, RedgGrass. Inside voice.
My point is that if people should be able to voice their opinions, as misinformed as they are, as long as they are being clear and humble about it
He 's too emotive (constant incredulity in his voice), slightly inarticulate ("You talk about…" is his go-to phrase) and he asks questions instead of answering them

*2017*
Also, in today's age of social media and such, fans have a much louder voice than they once did and I imagine because of it, players are even more reluctant to go with the direct transfer request due to the outpouring of abuse they'll receive
He did voice concerns about the pitch
I'm so glad they asked someone from the Internet to be the voice of each club
When I go next season in September, I'll be leaving my voice in Anfield.
Does anyone else read Hendo quotes in his voice?

**************

TARGET WORD: stubbornness

*2011-13*
He lost his way towards the end with his stubbornness
Very true, but also don 't discount the power and stubbornness of media narratives
His stubbornness not to change when people pointed out obvious flaws really annoyed me too
Rafa had a stubbornness regarding his team-sheets that used to aggravate me to no end; if Dalglish continues in the same vein with Carroll, even after Suarez returns, I may begin to agree with you.
I think the guy we've always wanted for his position is Dempsey and, despite the wrangling and stubbornness from Fulham, I think we'll get him in

*2017*
Agree. Stubbornness is necessary but too much is suicidal. Manchester City and us are experiencing it right now. 
The stubbornness is incredible
Yeah Klopps stubbornness is beginning to get on my nerves
Well, I for one am going to rest easy knowing that Klopp obviously (given his stubbornness to go for another CB) has his perfect league winning side in his mind, a side which we SHOULD be able to acquire with enough money and some luck (and not a transfer committee which fucks up our most sought after transfer)
I was implying I always saw Klopp's stubbornness at Dortmund as more related to budget than philosophy

**************

TARGET WORD: friendship

*2011-13*
The way Gerrard talks has me almost in tears, great story of friendship these two have
It was fueled by my friendship with a Scouser I had met at church (he had recently converted to Christianity)
I steer clear of talking about Football with my friends who support Man u because I know what their like with football and I avoid them to keep the friendship going
No secret he's unhappy at chelsea but I know he has a good friendship with a number of players
I think I'm going to miss seeing their friendship on the team the most of anything.

*2017*

Moreno having a worldie so he can stay on and continue his friendship with the brazilians
Friendship ended with Neymar. Now Bobby is my best friend
If there's a friendship still there, then maybe, at some time in the future, you can discuss this stuff that's bugging you (once you've recreated a platform upon which to ask about it)
Friendship ended with Sakho. Now Matip is my new best friend
Friendship ended with EUROPA LEAGUE. Now CHAMPIONS LEAGUE is my best friend

**************

TARGET WORD: egyptian

*2011-13*
soudns good man :) never met an egyptian lass, gonna have to find me one.
And the Egyptian girls
In the later, I happened to be catty-corner to an Egyptian church despite the fact that most of the neighborhood was Czech
Salah is pretty clearly a LFC target for a number of reasons, but I think the Egyptian thing is a nice added bonus
Here I go again on my own, walking like an Egyptian.

*2017*
It's Egyptian so isn't it a play on words of king tut? As opposed to being about fifa
Like that's how an average male Egyptian has been looking like since 2014 lmao https://imgur.com/a/HKX1m
Salah never left the Egyptian camp, he joined them on Monday and has been there all the time
"Scored like an Egyptian" WHAT?!?!
I haven't loved an Egyptian player since Aboutrika

**************

TARGET WORD: conservatives

*2011-13*
the Tea Party is more right ring than the Conservatives, who are conventionally seen as more right wing than democrats
Tories are certainly right of centre, but definitely left of American conservatives on many issues

*2017*
Fair enough, it just annoys me how often I see people touting the Lib Dems as the only viable alternative to Labour/Conservatives when the Green Party outperformed them in lots of constituencies at the last general election
We have the same phenomenon in Sweden more or less, albeit our conservatives/nationalists haven't seized power yet even though they are gaining ground rapidly
if the libdems (or another 3rd party) are more likely to win the seat than Labour, then it's better to vote for them as it increases the chance of the conservatives losing the seat
You might follow Liverpool. But supporting Liverpool means you support the city and it's history, which the conservatives tried to run into the ground. 
But yeah, complaining about who won is annoying (but they have the "right" to complain as the conservatives havn 't taken away that right yet)

**************

TARGET WORD: moaned

*2011-13*
Same with Alberto, I have a friend who loathes him moaned from the stands when he was subbed on, moaned after the game because he didn't do anything
People have moaned for Carroll to start, blamed Gerrard's absence, Suarez's suspension, Lucas's injury, etc, etc
sure there are complaints that were too optimistic but if everyone here bitched, moaned and talked shit all the time and to each other then this place would be no different from facebook or youtube comments
It's like when people moaned about Kelly going to the Euro's because he had never made a senior cap, he has to at some point
van der Vaart also moaned about not being in the starting line up back then (sound familiar?), thinking he should be there instead of Kuyt

*2017*
You all moaned are managers aren't passion enough, Who's even better than klopp to have aswell
Nobody really moaned about signing him iirc. We actually hoped he would turn out that way. Too early to say,but some encouraging signs. 
He's also moaned quite a bit about playing LB
I mean he's moaned about fixtures this season too, at Christmas.
Which I always thought was weird as the 99-00 third kit also had blue on it and no-one moaned then

**************

TARGET WORD: f5

*2011-13*
Damn after losing the F5 key on my keyboard due to extensive use, I am coming to think is just another rumor. Please let me be wrong on this!
It's worked for me. Try Ctrl-F5
I'm there, it just stuttered a few times and didn't catch up. I don't wanna F5 for fear of losing it completely (it's happened before).

*2017*
Why a VVD thumbnail?!? My heart leapt before I could read the title. When F5 is a curse, not a blessing...
Mouse, F5, Djik?
We are the f5 squad
Huge fucking Hog!!!!!!! This is what I F5 for
This is the sort of quality shit post I hope for when I F5. Hope for a lean has subsided

**************

TARGET WORD: labour

*2011-13*
Johnson missed the first game under Kenny due to his wife being labour, he was back for the next game against Blackpool and himself and Kelly played together up until the West Ham game in which Kelly got injured
He can sulk and withdraw his labour, but he won't be going to the World Cup and he'll be giving all the Champions League clubs another reason to question whether he's worth the hassle.
I believe it is part of the labour law in Spain that all employees have a buy-out clause.
It is also frustrating to see Man Utd spend less money on better players and have them bed in so quickly (in the case of Jones) and Downing, Carroll and Henderson (to a lesser extent) continue to labour
I came here hoping for some banter from other clubs fans calling Liverpool labour supporting dole scroungers

*2017*
Thinking exactly same thing, should be a rule not to bring politics in because not all Liverpool fans are going to support labour so will cause division.
I'm convinced that if Shanks had gone into politics he'd be a legendary Labour party figure
It's probably a fair assumption to make that the truth only came out under the Tory government because the inquiry had already started under Labour and they couldn't feasibly halt it
Voting for anything other than Labour in Liverpool is a waste
The contract is for both club and player, if the contract runs for x-years then the player is to be paid wages for x-years by that club and the club can expect x-years of labour from that player

**************

TARGET WORD: clench

*2011-13*
Every time he had the ball I had to clench my butthole a little.
Holy shit that run from Mirallas made my gut clench. Agger barely managed to clear the cross too. Pretty good start despite that though.
If we can clench that, and he still wants to leave, then sell him and we'll be able to bring in realistic replacements

*2017*
For Liverpool fans, every o'clock is clench o'clock.
Butt clench.
Butt clench: ENGAGE!!!
What a save Mignolet fucking hell I can't clench any harder
It's honestly so weird how i don't clench my butthole anymore when crosses come into our box. He's been immense over the last 10 games or so. 

**************

TARGET WORD: highlighter

*2011-13*
I will be watching with study guides and highlighter in hand
I hope Ian Ayre or whomever is dealing with the contracts gets a yellow highlighter out and goes over it properly with Suarez and his reps

*2017*
Fucking highlighter jerseys. Can we have a red, black and white one instead? Or a proper green? I'd even take a dull grey one.
Because it is similar to a highlighter which is essentially a small stick...
You ever used an orange highlighter? Imagine that with sleeves. 
Really wish it was more burnt orange like 00/01 than highlighter bullshit again.
What is it with day-glo highlighter bs? If we were gonna go orange, couldn't we have something closer to the 2000/01 away kit. Absolutely loved that shirt.

**************

TARGET WORD: pills

*2011-13*
hit Joe right in the pills.
Thank goodness we have a match thread in here while /r/soccer(/r/soccer) is on crazy pills.
I just wanted to make sure I wasn't taking crazy pills
If you think there's any chance Dalglish is staying you need to stop taking crazy pills
How good! After a night out on the pills I come home to watch LFC highlights and there's Cosmic Gate as the background music! That being said, this kid looks class...he reminds me a lot of David Silva with that left foot

*2017*
tell ur doctor u need some pills preemptively for this season he'll understand 
I feel like I 'm taking crazy pills
When it comes to the pills, I'm not sure there's any sign he wasn't in shape
Honestly Klopp's arrogance since August has been alarming on several fronts. This one really surprised me though, terrible management to let a player pop pills in their suffering. 
In regular season, Liverpool fans need heart attack pills no matter the score is 1:0 2:0 or 3:0. Even in the summer, these medication is needed

**************

TARGET WORD: astonishing

*2011-13*
It is astonishing that West Ham would offer Carroll a: massive eight-year contract on offer from West Ham that in total would be worth an astonishing £36 million
Like you said, the stupidity is astonishing.
You may not like his actions in this transfer move (I certainly don't), but we can't forget the fact that he produced some astonishing performances in the Liverpool shirt
Gary Neville is an incredible pundit. Which is astonishing because as a player he was one of the biggest cunts ever.
the naivety in this sub sometimes is astonishing.

*2017*
What's really astonishing is how good we were at set pieces and crosses.
I'm a bit of a fan of Bilbao's astonishing success, given their policy about Basque-only players. 
The contrast is astonishing but what really ticks me off is that he is a midfielder who doesn't want the ball and hides when the going gets tough
Even the fact that a player so young and so new to first team football was able to adapt so well was astonishing to me, it's a shame that he's been so unlucky with injuries because I think he had the potential to be a great player for us
He'll get a fair bit of game time in the league too. The rate of his development is astonishing 

**************

TARGET WORD: monitoring

*2011-13*
There are professionals including BR monitoring the Suarez scenario and they would take the best decision considering all inside sources and info ( which will be me MUCH more reliable than that of SkySports or The Telegraph).
QPR monitoring Degen. Everybody cross your fingers. 
Why do you think they're monitoring Agger specifically?
I honestly think De Vrij(http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2012/11/30/liverpool-fc-monitoring-feyenoord-centre-back-stefan-de-vrij-100252-32335207/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter) or Nicolas Isimat-Mirin are much more likely than any of those names you listed
can imagine someone monitoring the activity on wikipedia in America wonder why there's so many hits for some guy called Martin Kelly

*2017*
ARE WE BACK ON THE monitoring??????
commence the monitoring 
Is that a joke? We are kings of monitoring players for months and then not signing them. e: then not than
Either we're always rebuilding, transitioning, improving, monitoring, or waiting to buy that one or those 2 right players
its so they can spew the monitoring meme left and right

**************

TARGET WORD: backbone

*2011-13*
If the post has no backbone then isn't the downvote button enough?
As they have consistently been performing well in the Carling Cup this has been the backbone for them, and now they just about have some silverware within their grasp
I love having a manager with the backbone to bollock the players when they deserve it.
Build a backbone
Lucas is the backbone of this team without him we would be put under constant pressure

*2017*
Absolutely no backbone in this team. NO FUCKING backbone. Countinho's worth more than their entire squad, but they manage to march into Anfield and embarrass us, per usual.
We are not even talking about his mental state, just show some fucking balls, some backbone
So it looks like this can be traced back to Harvard having no backbone
DM is part of the problem I agree, but it goes further than that, signing one decent proven DM won't completely turn this squad into a title challenging side, the whole backbone needs to be stronger, if we brought in a world class DM, a world class CB and a world class Striker then I could see this squad being 10X the team we are currently We're not a million miles away from challenging but I think we need someone else to pair with Matip/Lovern and someone who can get you 20 goals a season and also a DM of course
Under Klopp, injuries hindered us, but Sakho-Lovren was the backbone of the run to the EL final

**************

TARGET WORD: soak

*2011-13*
If I was only ever going to see one which in my visit, I would get tickets for the kop end, so you really get to soak in that magnificent atmosphere that Liverpool was born on
Great moment to soak in the atmosphere.
It's where LFC started so soak up some history and get into the atmosphere
worst thing we could do right now would be bring on Carroll, as Stoke will just soak up all those long balls
What players have we added who will help us compete better with the top 6 teams in the league or solve the issue of being bullied by high tempo, physical teams who soak up our possession football and kill us on the break

*2017*
i think "NO" was statement enough. now they can watch phil soak up the glory in red all season.
It's ironic that so many people keep saying wait until they're tested and don't have teams sitting back when the team is literally designed to soak up pressure and play on the counter
After the change we gave up a lot of the initiative and seemed to soak up more of the pressure
We go 3-1 up around 75-80mins and what we should have done was sit back and soak up the pressure they were starting to put on us but we were naive and tried to keep hitting them on the counter and it cost us massively Now compare that to last night where we are on top and creating a lot of chances before we make the change to sit deep
Some games that style wont actually work, against teams who just sit back and soak up pressure

**************

TARGET WORD: implied

*2011-13*
And he didn 't call Brendan a liar, he implied that he was lied to, which for all we know might be the truth
I never implied it
Oh, fair enough then. I wasn't paying proper attention and some of the comments in the thread implied he had been.
I know that today we did our typical "cross it in and hope someone heads it" routine but we have many opportunities inside the box that go wasted and (like you implied) suck
Holy don't take such offense, I implied you *may* be full of shit becuase, lets face it, this is the time of year people claim to be experts on players they've never seen except on youtube

*2017*
However it is definitely implied. They aren't going to say something like that if they haven't been given positive feedback from Can's camp.
I simply said "I miss the days of not knowing our targets and signing players out of nowhere" I never implied I miss him
I really think this was the death knell for Mama's Liverpool career; before that Klopp had implied in interviews that if Sakho was willing to work his way back into the side, he'd find his way there
They compared him to a gorilla, which was seen as rude because Barkley has Nigerian ancestry, and implied Barkley was a drug dealer.
Jurgen seems to have implied that Phil will play when he gets his head on straight in a manner that doesn't hang him out to dry

**************

TARGET WORD: arrangement

*2011-13*
It would require 14 of the Premier League's 20 members to vote in favour of a new commercial arrangement
(If healthy) Hull *doesn't* have a big talented physical striker, the other CB can be picked to better play one of those guys, and Agger brings a ton in defensive arrangement, tackling, getting the ball forward, etc
I know some are saying (and I've even said) that Chelsea will probably try and use him in an exchange for Falcao but he may not agree to it, remember **he will more than likely get a say** regardless of what Chelsea want and his input could sour this arrangement
Obviously we only had him for this season and the fact he was not playing means its a no brainer to end the loan arrangement prematurely
Personally I don't think he fits the ownership's desire to divide up responsibilities but he did work under that arrangement at Inter (with poor results)

*2017*
How would a EPL arrangement legally bind other European clubs?
The diagonal arrangement gives our players the maximum amount of space to perform outrageous jinky moves, while ensuring there's always someone advancing to pass to
It is an arrangement by Tony Britten of Georg Frideric Handel 's "..
That's not a good arrangement.
I dunno, with better science, technology and maybe like awesome calcium supplements, we could make it a 20 year arrangement

**************

TARGET WORD: slave

*2011-13*
lots of connection to the slave era, so that's why it's probably not used at all
Maybe. Honestly I think he isn't that conniving, he is just a slave to emotion.
Suarez is a phenomenal player and seems to be a good human being, but he is immature and a slave to his emotions
Maybe he did, I think he bought up the child soldier/slave thing, or at least tried to.

*2017*
60 hours a week? what are you a slave??
Be careful or you might get pulled by the facial recognition drones and sent to work as Alex Fergusons sex slave for up to 6 months
Some may disagree with this citing that squad depth has been very detrimental to us recently, and some may praise him for it with the idea that team is not a slave to money being a great thing
That shouldn't even matter. If he doesn't want to play for Cameroon, it's his decision. They shouldn't be coercing him to play, he's not a fucking slave. 
Qatar doesn’t use actual slave Labour

**************

TARGET WORD: snake

*2011-13*
Whatever striker is signed, unless they snake Lukaku, it will probably be fairly inexpensive as he will be our 3rd option
there is one species of snake in Britannia
"also hate stuff like snakes n that (not my snake tho)" -_
It will be difficult but we can cope without this snake
Lucky guy, Im getting treated to some snake soup in an hour or so then to the movies :p

*2017*
Fuck off Sterling you fucking snake
Klavan smesh little snake
Hope millie gives the snake a fucking nightmare
Get fucked snake
Pre-snake Sterling was the best Sterling I've seen.

TARGET WORD: revisionist

*2011-13*
26 goals and 17 assists in 61 matches, 2 goals in the greatest Premier League match and he was our worst signing **ever**? Talk about revisionist history.
As you said, people tend to be very revisionist about these things in order to put the current team and manager on a pedestal, but I don't see why we can't simply acknowledge that both were good.
That said, this is a bunch of revisionist bullshit
It's not revisionist history.
Not having this work out is a big blow, revisionist threads like this don't change that.

*2017*
It's 100% revisionist history saying that people were't complaining about him the entire time he was at liverpool(https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1i8bci/what_do_liverpool_fans_think_of_brendan_rodgers/) and reviewing his performance with us critically(https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/379ge8/a_thesis_on_keeping_rodgers_cross_post_rsoccer/)
I really like him don't get me wrong, I love how much he runs and he's far from a bad player but I think we're being a bit too revisionist on it to be honest
Outside of 18 months we were awful under him and there's far too much revisionist history about how good we actually were under him apart from one season where 4 players carried the team and had to rely on scoring more than the other team because he couldn't sort out the defence 
Don't try and be revisionist about him due to how he was during the last part of his contract here
These comments are so hilariously revisionist. We don't sign anyone in January and suddenly people forget we got Mane, Wjinaldum and Matip in the summer.

I remember when I went to a match in 2005, this fucker had pitchforks, shovels and shit in the back seat of his car! Obviously he moves it for us

*2017*
There is no coal left. Everyone throw their shovels in!
The only thing we need to get out is our shovels so we can put more coal into this hype train motherfucker can't stop won't stop
I will get the vans and shovels out.
I can't take much more of this *tearfully shovels coal into the hype train furnace*
then how would we know if we need our pitchforks or our shovels?

**************

TARGET WORD: participate

*2011-13*
Find a local kickaround team, 5 or 7 a side, turn up and participate
But I still don't find it fun enough to want to participate
The English FA also has two (three if you include the Community Shield) domestic competitions for clubs to participate in besides their own league
Irony being if we managed to achieve CL in the future and then were unable to participate due to massively busting FFP.
I am by no means an awesome FIFA player but would love to participate in a tournament even if I lose in the first round. PS3 Zha_Ni_Kam_Bo.

*2017*
Feel free to participate and pledge money to a charity of your choice while betting on LFC to win something! Of course I will still be expecting you to get that tattoo whatever you decide to do a charitable bet or not!
I'm opening it to everyone that wants to participate and I have created a new table for this summer transfer window.
If a club wants to participate in a sport it has to comply with the *laws* of the game
Only a maximum of 5 teams from one country/association can participate in the UCL or UEL.
And to tell people to 'not be political' while they participate in social events as private persons thats the stuff dictatorships are made of

**************

TARGET WORD: thunder

*2011-13*
is that thunder or does someone have a cannon?
I'm just happy to see my favorite basketball team represented in my favorite football teams subreddit! You'll never thunder up alone!
He should know, having spent so much time in that country trying to sell cans of Thunder Muscle.
My nickname was Riise in school. Wasn't because of the thunder foot though, it's 'cause I'm ginger.
He looks like a spanish villain from the Thunder Birds

*2017*
The very fact that we 're referring to this kit as "toxic thunder" can only mean it 's wank as fuck
Didn't we win the last game that we played while wearing the toxic thunder kit?
Two negatives make one positive eh? Go for the toxic thunder! 
I bought a toxic thunder shirt
Hated Toxic Thunder, then the shirts went on sale after season's end for about $18, so I got one because that's cheaper than a T-shirt at a concert

**************

TARGET WORD: mouthpiece

*2011-13*
He used to be Mr reliable, now i think he's just a mouthpiece spewing out whatever message barca want hawked about this week
Basically Guardiola gets a mouthpiece on a well regarded website, and ornstein gets a reliable source for his stories, both win.
Ornstein has been guardiola 's mouthpiece through this, that will be his "sources close to the player"
Players have been feeling this way for eons. Just now twitter gives them a mouthpiece. One they can use to their advantage?
Tom Werner is his mouthpiece for Liverpool FC. Tom/John are in constant communications, FSG is based in Boston so Henry will be there 95% of the time.

*2017*
It 's especially strange because all of the usual mouthpiece 's (Pearce, Joyce, Barrett, etc.) were so quick to announce and reassure "THE FOOT IS NOT BROKEN!!1!" when the rumors were flying around that that was what happened but obviously it was a lot more serious than just "a bad bruise".
Well that sounds like a club mouthpiece to me as it quickly come out after Sky did it, Said the club are adamant if I recall correctly
Closer to an old school mate who's high up in the club, or brother who's involved with the ownership rather than him being an employee or James Pearce style mouthpiece.
which is also a reminder of how much of a mouthpiece these Barca journalists were fucking embarrassing for them
But taking club mouthpiece James Pearce's report that he definitely won't be sold as gospel is only going to crush you more if it *does* happen.

**************

TARGET WORD: bottling

*2011-13*
Not sure if this is Daglish's tactic or it's the players bottling it and just taking the easy option but it worked tonight sometimes because the opponents weren't able to stop it.

*2017*
Let's hope this season brings us back into the top four, which i genuinely believe we are going to manage given that the team is so focused on not bottling it against worse teams.
Well everyone else is bottling, so that's something. Hopefully Sturridge can get us over the line tonight.
Also, it isn't so much bad luck because bottling it vs shit teams has become a trend ;Bournemouth, Swansea, West Ham, Sunderland, something must change if we're going to get top 4.
Bottle Jobs the lot of them. We've gone from bottling the final/semi to pissing away a whole season the second we started thinking of the title/top 4.
Something I noticed is that the bottling against burnley and struggling against plymouth argyle gives the weaker teams a sense of motivation that with consistency and concentration they can hold off our disorganized offense and just long ball in a 1-0 win

**************

TARGET WORD: leans

*2011-13*
I've never hoped a person leans on something as much as this
He leans less awkwardly than Aspas!
But it doesn't imply innocence either, if anything it leans towards getting away with something
They're all smart and aware enough to keep an eye on each other so they don't get in each other's way and they can all benefit from the power that Sturridge brings as he leans on the last defender to try and create space for them to play in. 
and leans on something.

*2017*
Thursday morning leans incoming
Then we can clench the coal and turn it into sweet, flawless, rock solid LEANS
I'm expecting multiple leans in different positions.
Trying to save millions can't be a bad thing even if its frustrating for us that just want to see fucking leans :)
I WANNA SEE SOME LEANS NOW

**************

TARGET WORD: emotion

*2011-13*
You don't want someone who is full of emotion to take a free kick
It was a little like an anti-Istanbul: the venue, the team, the result, the emotion... all the opposite of Istanbul. 
I second that *emotion*. 
what makes it beyond just a game is our undying human emotion to support and feel belonged
Maybe. Honestly I think he isn't that conniving, he is just a slave to emotion.

*2017*
The emotion part is where he says Coutinho doesn 't want to play for Liverpool again
When I traveled to Anfield a few years ago and got to sing along with the Kop it was such a rush of emotion that I was in tears
In post game Klopp said he wanted to give Migs a break because he had just played an "intense" few weeks of football with a lot of emotion
But the overwhelming emotion I am feeling now is absolute hopelessness
His job is to convey the emotion and events of a match

**************

TARGET WORD: preventing

*2011-13*
I believe it comes from back in the day when people had silver cutlery, which would usually be stored in the top drawer (preventing awkward bending in polite company)..
But he made some pretty marvelous tackles to break up Swansea's play, preventing hold up play by their strikers and making very key interceptions and headers where things could've been worse.
Clearly they have nothing else to put shame on Suarez and preventing him to win the award.
If Liverpool matched Spurs at 30 million pounds, and Spurs upped their bid to 35, was there anything preventing Anzhi from rejecting Liverpool's 30 million bid for Spurs'
Anyways it's not FSG that are preventing us from spending money on players, they have given the club money to spend, its other factors that are stopping us from signing players

*2017*
Their main argument was that it has the added safety benefit of preventing people from falling forward onto others (i.e
I believe he said something like "Liverpool preventing Coutinho from joining Barcelona", as if how DARE we have the audacity to not happily sell him.
In the meantime they could line up a replacement whilst preventing VVD from playing for another club in the first 3 games.
I 've not said anything should be forbidden or preventing people from posting what they want or think
The article is not aimed at preventing depression after the new year but it emphasises that people should not get already depressed a few days after the window has opened

**************

TARGET WORD: sentence

*2011-13*
Did you just use right foot and suso in the same sentence? Our little man is growing up..
That is all over the place! If he put a comma on the end of "after you" it just might make sense, but that is still quite a mind bending sentence.
Your last sentence is the worst of the worst
Yes, I definitely said *f#ck, sh#t,* and *Moses* in the same sentence on Sunday.
That injury is a death sentence for many players careers

*2017*
*As determined by ESPN.com with people connected to the player* And with that opening sentence, I can safely dismiss this article.
not sure if second sentence was a lowkey jab at Origi or not 😂
See? You don't believe that. You couldn't even bring yourself to finish the sentence. 
Only team I hate more than Liverpool are United Never have I seen a sentence that more accurately sums up being a Liverpool fan
I'm sure Neymar would have told him that if you aren't Messi you want be anything. Sorry, but ... what does this sentence mean?

**************

TARGET WORD: neck

*2011-13*
Posted this last night. It also explains the grey part around the neck on the away kit. Good stuff.
Additionally, Villas-Boas not only had several huge egos in the dressing room, he also had a madman breathing down his neck.
Scholes and Gerrard are neck to neck on long passing, *maybe*
Here's(http://store.liverpoolfc.tv/LFC-Mens-70-s-Retro-V-Neck/pid-36086) the awesome shirt.
but once you look at neck and see that it looks like a bow tie, it's very hard to unsee

*2017*
What is that shit around his neck?
he didn't have city and tottenham breathing down his neck, top 4 wasn't an achievement for us at the time it was the minimum
I love it except for the V neck
Absolutely love the designs. My only suggestion would be a crew neck instead of V neck, but then again that's just my preference.
Let me just post this screen shot to show I am a "real fan" wind your neck in son

**************

TARGET WORD: desert

*2011-13*
And for desert utd are 1 nil down to Sunderland. Great match going on at the stadium of light.
As an American football fan, I feel stranded on a desert island and all my fellow football buddies are off on a far away land
No we don't, it's like Sahara Desert
in a remote tiny desert oasis on the west coast town 980kms from the nearest city where i live yes..
I'll never desert my side. Never.

*2017*
Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down, never gonna run around and desert you
Way better than the dry, dull Texas desert I live in
I'm Egyptian and I can tell you we don't live in the desert(or at least +95% of us(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Egypt))
I'm at Anfield now and can confirm Salah's arrival. Ground staff creating a desert themed pitch for his unveiling!
The natural soil is either a mud pit or actual arid cracked desert ground that's injured more players than the opposition

**************

TARGET WORD: independence

*2011-13*
But today LFC have taken a place into my heart! Massive respect to this club!” > The date was March 26 2013, Independence Day in Bangladesh
So when America did their whole war of independence shit, by your logic, that meant they weren't a separate country from England?
We ***WE?!?!*** I'll have you know I'm British! We just loaned you independence!...and that nutmeg.
there is a genuine belief that a southern political elite have slowly but surely eroded the independence of the old northern powerhouses
Our equivalent would be UKIP (UK Independence Party) probably

*2017*
Happy Independence Day
UKIP is the UK Independence Party
Bit disappointed there was no message for Pakistani Independence day yesterday... :-(
Well the whole independence debate is more about Madrid influence being too far right wing than Catalunya is comfortable with, plus the fact La Liga is based in Madrid
Happy Independence Day(https://youtu.be/EwLWNXFH2rg)

**************

TARGET WORD: stubborn

*2011-13*
let it go. just reminds me of this Family Guy: Stubborn Mule(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcHWeAzoXd4)
You also have a stubborn Frenchman at the helm that is seemingly absolutely against deviating from his philosophy while that very philosophy is seemingly keeping you from winning trophies
And lots of bottom-half Premier League teams like to play 4-4-2 which in terms of defense is very stubborn to penetrate
How many players these days would have sticked around for 3 years to prove themselves to stubborn/entitled fans, while simultaenously being the scape goat to the clubs on the pitch misfortunes
Perhaps. He's also incredibly stubborn and unused to not getting exactly what he wants. His actions if he stays are, at best, unpredictable. 

*2017*
He also is super stubborn about playing a set style of high line pressing football against teams who that plays into their hands
If LFC is too stubborn to understand that, the club will miss out on good players
Not likely, considering Klopp seems too stubborn
Liverpool have proven they can't break down stubborn owners and you want to start on one of the most notorious owners with 2 weeks left
Think Klopp is pretty much the best coach in the World bar maybe 1 or 2, but I think he needs to be a bit less stubborn in the transfer window and not be afraid overspend a bit

**************

TARGET WORD: fax

*2011-13*
Unplug that fax machine as soon as we 're back at Melwood BR!
a throwback to the great Liverpool office fax machine jamming of 1993.
I hope that was the only reply Arsenal got from him regarding the offer. No fax or email, just a tweet. 
If the Madrid internet goes down, they could always call or fax over an offer
So our away matches next season will be 10 broken fax machines and a broken telly (goalie's kit)

*2017*
Send the fax 1 min after the deadline.
Fuck Real and their stupid fax machine.
Out of curiosity, I vaguely remember the De Gea fax machine thing. Can you elaborate more on this as I don't recall it all?
It's funny, the only deal we actually wanted to go through, a stupid fax machine messed up.
A fax machine has cost us about 5 goals

**************

TARGET WORD: parking

*2011-13*
Very important that we score early in this game to add urgency and get Villa actively searching for possession instead of parking the bus and knocking it long on counters
Otherwise there is some street parking along next to Everton Park, but could be a bit shady (havent seen anything wrong but you never know)
I hope we won't have to resort to parking the bus, as I see it'll be hard to keep possession against such a balanced squad
Against a team like Stoke, who were clearly parking the bus, we needed a tactical approach to stretch their back line
I guess you're ok for parking then?! Just looking for a place to park for FREE! Enjoy the game pal

*2017*
It might not be Liverpool's preferred formation but with half the league parking the bus, it might end up being the most common formation.
Parking the bus against kids
Parking the bus is when a team sticks 11 men behind the ball and have no interest in attacking
Against United they were parking the bus
At times, theis no difference between Lovren and a strategically placed parking bollard

**************

TARGET WORD: relieved

*2011-13*
You're relieved we didn't get Dempsey? For six fucking million? Are you kidding me?
When Gerrard missed, I was kicking and screaming. When Adam missed, I couldn't even move. So relieved. 
I wish him all the best but Christ I'm relieved he is gone
2-0. So happy and relieved right now. Keep calm and carry on, lads!
Good 'ol Kia must be relieved to know FSG took the hit on that one.

*2017*
I'm just relieved it's over and we can move forward.
Most relieved I've been for a long time
Very, very relieved. Mbappe isn't worth £80m nevermind £100m as seen here or whatever PSG eventually paid for him.
The bvb post was relieved a lot of stress for me and they spoke about how until they got a top class striker they had the same problem
I'm relieved we sorted out CR56 a few years ago, or else we could've been splashing out more than a billion pounds this summer on him alone 

**************

TARGET WORD: graduate

*2011-13*
He just signed a contract worth more a week than I will make a year when I graduate and the guy drinks Corona
I've worked in journalism for ten years (as in paid employment) and I would take a hundred Barton's over a college graduate with good grammar
He's actually here in the US, but he wants to do post-graduate in the UK. 
B-B-B-But hes a youth academy graduate! We allr emember how good he was against Madrid 5 years ago!
As someone with a graduate degree in journalism, this comment makes my head hurt. 

*2017*
Managed to graduate from the university of Liverpool with a 2:1, found out whilst travelling in New Zealand
you probably wouldn't have liked him anyway. he is a United academy graduate.
In other news, I graduate today
I made a bad choice behind the wheel of a car and the resulting injuries completely ended my career before I even GRADUATEd high school
We need to graduate from selling club to winning club and players need to be kept for as long as possible, especially when they signed a contract 6 months ago

**************

TARGET WORD: coal

*2011-13*
Twist: he eats hot coal for breakfast. 
YOU GOT coal BITCH
The way I would describe him is a coal that's plopped right in the middle of giant turd 
when the price of coal falls 50% and the price of gold 30% the guy who is worth $7 billion because he owns a stake in Russia's largest gold and coal mines, and then a large stake in potash, is suddenly screwed
Which is why I said he's a coal that's in the middle of a turd.

*2017*
guys put the coal back, it's over *drops shovel* *falls to the ground* *starts crying*
Shit son im outa coal.... WHERE DOES ONE GET SOME COAL?!?
Shit or coal, same shovels
I think the arsenal supporters have some spare coal
WE NEED MORE COAL LADS!!!   

**************

TARGET WORD: behaviour

*2011-13*
>with the exception of his random bad behaviour That's stupid. Without his bad behaviour there wouldn't even be a discussion about whether he should leave or not.
Im not so sure being good at football is a good enough reason to support such poor behaviour. 
Sure has a few behaviour problems does he not? Sounds like too much hassle.
I was referring to "football politics" as in Suarez wouldn 't get it because of his past behaviour...I know what I mean!
We can't be seen to condone this type of behaviour

*2017*
Exactly Coutinho will be just as good in a World Cup year, he's always been a model professional on the pitch, not a single instance of poor behaviour
So the fans that go to the games and seem to share the same behaviour are the only Real Madrid fans who would do it
I was as furious as anyone when he joined United, which made his behaviour before leaving the club all the more irritating
The rest is as stupid now as it was at the time, deluded fans trying to justify the behaviour of a player when it's clear as day to anyone not fucking stupid it was said in anger and meant in a derogatory way, go watch it again, does he say it with a smile on his face or with malice
Sakho repeatedly upset everybody for years with his poor behaviour

**************

TARGET WORD: alternatives

*2011-13*
Both are obviously perceived by management as alternatives behind the striker and out wide, no? So for all their differences, they'd be used in the same positions?
First, the players you suggested as alternatives for our transfers are largely irrelevant, as there is the issue of wages to consider
I don't even want Walcott at Liverpool. He has some talent but I think he is completely overrated and would much rather see BR go for other alternatives. 
However, a problem we have is that we don't have too many alternatives out on the wing
Suarez alternatives?

*2017*
Someone Said alternatives? https://i.imgflip.com/6jp1b.jpg?a417216
VVD alternatives. 
there are a lot of alternatives who wouldn't even cost as much! I have been wondering the last few days.
If losing out on Van Dijk means we aren't going to be seeking alternatives (ala Keita), I'm happy to see us spend up to £80m for the fucker.
Can't lowball if you actively don't search for alternatives

**************

TARGET WORD: parked

*2011-13*
Dowd's assistant has his ass parked 25 yards upfield, and is in no position to make the call he is supposed to make
Yes, but it's not like he masterminded a brilliant tactic against Barca. He parked the bus and prayed for the best.
West Ham parked the bus all game but that takes nothing away from how their defense performed
Reading's goalkeeper was possessed by a brick wall, and West Ham parked the bus
Yeah the one time I parked nearby, a few kids came out from a nearby house and charged me £10 to "watch the car", which can be interpreted as "to not break into my car"

*2017*
We're a lot slower moving it around a parked bus, and there have been a lot of times (last night included) where we can play long through balls or switch the play wide, and those longer passes are just ever so slightly overhit or mis-placed and a decent chance to get in behind just becomes a goal-kick instead
A lot of people focus on him having to cut in on his right foot, especially against "parked buses" (as if crosses are ever going to be our solution there with our tiny attacking line), but that also meant he could offer good combination-play and help build the attack on that flank in a way that a natural left-footer can 't do as easily.
We could chuck him on for the last ten if we're bombarding a parked bus
Klopp is accountable for that loss, there's no two ways about it. His team is unable to break down a parked bus, and he can't solve it.
This is me in my room, doing traditional aboriginal rain dances during games against parked buses so that maybe the goals will fall from the sky and into the net.

**************

TARGET WORD: lottery

*2011-13*
and your lottery number predictions please?
So basically your the type of person that would win the lottery and be gutted about paying tax
Liverpool's were 'Lottopool' because they're about as predictable as the lottery, and 'Robin Hood' since they take points from the rich (big clubs) and give to the poor (QPR)
Postcode lottery.
Mignolet was so fuckin pumped after that save, like he won the lottery or something

*2017*
Got the lottery numbers too pal? 
I 'm just not very good at it yet! It just goes "pits of despair > ridiculous, coke fuelled, triple lottery win optimism." A couple more seasons of klopp and ill get the hang of it!
So, while they may not be the quadruple rollover lottery win Theyre still a lottery win and that'll do me nicely.
Any thoughts on what numbers I should pick for the lottery
I don't think you can credit him as making EA into a moneymaking machine as much as the person who invented Ultimate Team (for Madden and then subsequently FIFA), which initially was a bit of a one off idea that magically turned into a moneymaking machine when they realised that convincing/psychologically guiding children towards buying what is ostensibly gambling/digital lottery tickets is extremely profitable.

**************

TARGET WORD: hype

*2011-13*
Anyone can make an account and hype up any player to no end
Despite all the Papadopolous hype, I am excited at the possibility of Alderweireld coming to LFC. The perfect example of a ball-playing defender.
If you think the way Henderson is playing now is the same as Gerrard at that age then you simply didn't watch Gerrard Gerrard was better than twice Coutinho was this last half-season, was already the captain for a season and a half, was already seen as having developed into one of the best players in the world and had 5x the hype
Word is, Downing for 16mil is pretty much a lock. Even at that price, I'm not happy about it. Never understood the hype.
Not to mention Eriksen really hasn't lived up to the hype

*2017*
CHOO CHOO! ALL ABOARD THE hype TRAIN! 
Watch us only sign Ox. That would be the worst possible comedown to the last couple of days' insane hype, and would be entirely our style.
3 games in 2017/18 season and still undefeated. Take your seat in our hype train, bandwagoners! 
You guys hype players way too much. It's a long way for them to fall.
Also, Woodburn and Gomez hype!

**************

TARGET WORD: hugs

*2011-13*
hugs he is such a tender soul.
He probably gets close to 50 requests a day at Melwood. I'm sure it wasn't anything personal. *hugs*
and the hugs! We need more hugs
Hahaha. Skrtle is like an angry looking biker that happily gives you bear hugs. 
The hugs have been great. I can't decide between Sturridge+Coutinho or Sturridge+BR as my favourite. They were both so warm and emotional.

*2017*
Imagine the amount of hugs a few beers deep haha
Love how you know that kid doesn't give a fuck about a signature or getting his dirty top just wants more hugs! 
Depends... do I get Klopp hugs in North Korea?
i mean i get that klopp hugs are nice and playing with the King of Egypt 🇪🇬(http://www.kingfut.com/2017/07/19/chamberlain-elneny-salah-king-of-egypt/) is attractive, plus we have Vanfield 🚗
Klopp hugs are more addictive than cocaine.

**************

TARGET WORD: semifinals

*2011-13*
Suarez: I want to dedicate to Muamba the goal and the FA Cup semifinals qualification. Keep fighting buddy, don't give up! You will make it!!
FA Cup 2012 semifinals: Liverpool Everton 14/04/2012 Full match downloads and Highlights
But Rafa's been in 4 European finals in his last 8 full seasons, winning 3 + 3 other semifinals and a quarter final, and with nuthouse owners.
I agree with that, but it would be nice to make some cup semifinals/finals as well, considering no Europa League

*2017*
I see us reaching the UCL semifinals within 2 years
We're going to be the giantkillers in the CL next season, reaching the semifinals.
Play our backups in the FA cup fixture so that our starters will have a good one and a half weeks break before the EFL semifinals.
Let's not forget he was a standout performer in Monaco's CL run to semifinals.
semifinals is really pushing it, we'd be a last 16 team at best imo

**************

TARGET WORD: patient

*2011-13*
Be patient
im not sure why they are not taking a more patient approach
Just keep in mind that Fergie didn't win a trophy for his first 4-5 seasons with the Mancs, not saying that's something to shoot for but we need to be patient and look at the big picture
Newcastle forced us to be patient and try to pry through their 9 men behind the ball tactic
I think they both have huge roles to play in our squad, and if they can both be patient and wait to shine when they're called on, we will be very good in midfield going forward

*2017*
This will eventually open doors to us if we are patient
Liverpool is simply not patient enough for young players to grow and develop
Only time will tell, but he has all the attributes that Stevie did at the same age and in the same way Houllier was patient with Stevie and helped him develop at the right speed I think Klopp will help Trent
The reason Sturridge has been mostly fit under Klopp is because he's more patient than Rodgers and makes sure he's 100% before using him
Play wide with holding possession and be patient

**************

TARGET WORD: shovel

*2011-13*
"I grew up, not with a silver spoon, but with a silver shovel," said Rodgers wistfully
they just need to build. It's been too fucking long just put the shovel in the ground for christ sakes. 
Idiots wouldn 't see good business people if they smacked them in the face with a shovel
If you smacked me in the face with a shovel, I wouldn't see much either.

*2017*
DON'T ASK STUPID FUCKING QUESTIONS JUST FUCKING shovel
***GO FIND THE shovel STRETCHER.*** 
you boys know how to shovel coal? 
GOT ME SHOVEL
BE QUIET AND shovel SOME MORE coal 

**************

TARGET WORD: roast

*2011-13*
Roast me if you like - but I\'m just saying

*2017*
Don't roast me for this, but is Can better at the #6 spot than Hendo?
All my twat mates are gonna roast me in school for the result. 
Someone get Carra a mic and a list of footballers to roast. People need to see this happen.
Cant wait for Skip Bayless to roast Pogba after every game
Another delicious HOG roast 🔥🐗

**************

TARGET WORD: leaks

*2011-13*
God damned /r/soccer leaks...
Everyone always hates the leaks that they see, then they hate them when they come out, then they hate them for the start of the season, then at the end of the season they fucking love them
He has also already publically stated that he will be handling all transfers behind closed doors (unless the other party leaks i.e
Nicest "leaks" I 've seen so far. We 'll just have to wait and see what we get.
The home kit was fairly close to the leaks, and from Warrior's teaser, it was exactly as expected

*2017*
The agent stuff and leaks were dodgy, but it’s what Barca do every time.
Klopp said the players at LFC were good enough and there were leaks that FSG only fired Brendan so early because they thought Klopp could still bring in the title in his first season given <8 games were played
It's nice to know who we're going for (although it usually ends in disappointment when we don't get them) but when leaks to our own local journos get published it only causes issues (like the VVD saga) I know it's an impossible ask of a Journalist whose job is to get people to read their articles, but I just wish we could find a way to keep them on-side, maybe hold back their article for a few days while the club work a deal out etc
Either the club failed to control unintentional leaks, or they chose to leak this
Well he was a little pussy by not going to Klopp in person and handing in a formal letter, instead he sends an email and leaks it to the press only just after LFC owners officially said he was not going, making LFC look stupid! 

**************

TARGET WORD: croatian

*2011-13*
Thanks mate, but I have sopcast. Just not a big fan of Serbo-Croatian commentary.
I think he might have Croatian nationality, which would explain why would be looking at him.
Mine too since I'm Croatian as well.
Liverpool have taken 15 year old Croatian midfielder Silvio Malkoc on trial from NK Trnje. (Reliable?)
I'm extremely biased since I'm Croatian, but I also watched him a lot, and he's a really really good player, lots of creativity and good movement with a great finish(except the goddamn miss against Spain in 2012 :( )

*2017*
I also hate to be that guy to comment to the same person multiple times in a thread, but Dejan is ethnically Croatian, thats not where he is from
as a Croatian I like that Mainz kit
I am Croatian and ffs I am shaking whenever Lovren plays for Croatia
meh personally don't hate Real that much guess it's easier for me when they have Croatian players
Yeah, I really like Rakitic, and I really like the Croatian NT in general

TARGET WORD: strings

*2011-13*
I just read article after article without actual quotes so I want to wish someone is pulling the strings
what are you supposed to do with the strings? tie them together? 
Does anyone think BR is pulling the strings behind this
Personally I welcome their tighter grip on the purse strings
strings would be very cool! I'm a bass player so I have that part covered :P But thank you very much! I very well might do that!

*2017*
Naturally they tightened the purse strings a bit after that
When I say challenging games, I mean games against the top 8 sides in the premier league feel like they've popped up every week or two weeks for us while Tottenham, Arsenal, United City and Chelsea have had strings of easy fixtures on paper
What about those strings of 1-0 victories we had last season?
We always knew it was Barca pulling the strings, but at the end of the day Coutinho chose to say those things. 
I think they are only linked with him because Neymar's been pulling strings to get his Brazilian buddies to join him there

**************

TARGET WORD: revisionism

*2011-13*
Unfortunately in Liverpool's case, the imbalance in coverage has persisted beyond any one manager (although Kenny's PR probably intensified it for his time in charge while the revisionism that has occurred after Hodgson's sacking compared to what was said during his tenure is as amusing as it is sad)
Not a fan of all this Gary Neville historical revisionism

*2017*
Your post is the revisionism. For those of us who have been around we remember
The revisionism and "never rated him anyway" is in full swing and it 's absurd
While Migs looks great now can we not have this revisionism that Migs was always a good keeper because he was bang average to a liability for 3 seasons
Not sure what the revisionism to do with Lucas and Stewart is
Seriously. What revisionism is going on in that post? Can's been the better player of the course of their Liverpool careers? Are you fucking joking me?

**************

TARGET WORD: entourage

*2011-13*
Anybody remember that one episode of entourage where Vince was betting on football, and there was a Man U game followed immediately by a Brazil game
He watches entourage! My man!
Is it just me, or is it nice for us all to see them hauling their own luggage without a huge entourage? 

*2017*
Frankly I don't really care what he or his entourage or whoever says, outside of maybe losing a bit of respect for him not just owning it
Also lots of white players have an "entourage"...(https://twitter.com/Chris78Williams/status/885783595150868480)
Dele was going out with my oldest family friend for quite a while, was with her yday actually! Also was in the queue for pinks with him, he had no entourage of suck ups (like Chilwell loves to have) and everything I hear is that he really is a lovely guy
Thing about Cout is, I feel it was his entourage pushing for a move and not him
Everyone has an entourage these days.

**************

TARGET WORD: listened

*2011-13*
He said he stopped talking to him because he never listened, Carra used never know what he was going to do next
Wish I could have watched the game my stream was too infuriating to bear it, I just listened to the lads on SSN
I just listened for the first time yesterday
If you listened to Rodgers' post-match conference, he mentioned the major problem to be decision-making
Sadly I was busy working and missed watching a majority of the game, but had my headphones on and listened to the commentary and Downing was definitely involved in a lot of the good plays

*2017*
approximately thats when i listened to them:P, not played guitar hero tho'
Perhaps he has come to the realization that in his all-in bid to get a move to Barcelona when under a new 5 year contract, he listened to the wrong voices and took actions that have perhaps negatively impacted the whole of his career for years to come at both club and national team
lol i've just listened to the interview from 2007
I listened to ball street podcast the other day and yup he is a bit of a cunt
Sure if you listened to this sub you would think Moreno was the best LB who ever lived

**************

TARGET WORD: congestion

*2011-13*
Someone tell Sterling to stay wide please. He's creating too much congestion in the middle. Needs to drag players away.
would have been nice if we had a few more rounds of the league cup against championship (or lower) sides, for Alberto and others to get some starts, I would expect the holidays with the fixture congestion to see him get more time, I like what I've seen so far.
Something big to prove and players are always sluggish this time of year due to fixture congestion
I think he is going to be a very important player for us in December because of fixture congestion
People only care about the Europa League if they reach the semis or final for big clubs, and while advancing in it may be big for smaller clubs the major travel and fixture congestion can be very unwelcome on the often smaller squads of mid or lower league teams

*2017*
I doubt it. We don't have any fixture congestion for the rest of the season. 
or just if there 's more space needed due to Cup congestion for certain teams ?
Yes it's another fixture when we don't need one, but I'd expect a very similar XI to today to play the away leg, and very few of today's players would be in contention for our Southampton semi-final or our PL matches, so the fixture congestion doesn't affect them.
I think they will be around the first team alot and probably will play in the cups and a handful of prem games depending on the fixture congestion
Fixture congestion + injuries + AFCON + Matip 'ban'

**************

TARGET WORD: scorpion

*2011-13*
too this day never met a snake in the wild other then the 10 or so iv hit driving to the city (straight 10 hour drive) spiders on the other hand are everywhere (no one has died of a spedier bite in oz since 81) you just need to be vigalant cockroaches more common then ants never seen a scorpion but then again iv never been in there habitat (just shake out your shoes b4 you put them on bro tip) drop bears they will probably kill you sting rays kids go out and hunt them for fun sharks i would be ten times more scared of a car while crossing the street box/jelly fish dont go over east and swim (carry a botle of vinegar in the car) kangaroos just stay away from them and be extremly careful on the road at night nothing really much that can kill you other then the heat if your car breaks down or you go to a area that is infested with drugged up junkies(modern bogans) and aborigines (meekathara port headland) 
3-2 to us, Suarez scores, then they fluke/buy 2 goals from Webb, Fabio off the bench to equalise and Carragher to score a scorpion kick (or perhaps just a header) in stoppage time for the match!
It's like going for a scorpion kick when you can score an open goal tap-in

*2017*
If not a scorpion kick, is there a name for that shot?
Mignonlet to roll it out the box and individually turn every player, then cross it to himself for a scorpion kick that retrospectively gets goal of the season
I like Giroud's scorpion a bit more, but this is easily second.
None comes to mind but loved Girouds honesty about the luck involved in his scorpion goal.
I hear it was an overhead scorpion kick from the halfway line. Pity they didn't catch it on video 

**************

TARGET WORD: programme

*2011-13*
My Dad worked on his house a few months ago, got his testimonial programme signed by him personally, and hung on my wall ^_^
Gerrard fitness benefiting from specific treatment programme. Rodgers reveals the lenghts club are going to keep Stevie fit
The bells and whistles for centenary stand are just a free programme and access to the bar, and a padded seat i think
You are not as much as fan as a Liverpudlian whose entire family supports Liverpool, who spends a large chunk of his wages on season tickets, pays for the programme on match day, and watches the Reserve team and Youth team matches
Based on said programme, he also seems very settled at Liverpool

*2017*
1:30 kick off or is that when the programme starts? 
A pilot programme of a standing section has worked very well at Celtic Park and looks set to expand in the near future
The Anfield Wrap should get a page or two in the match programme if they don't already. 
there used to songs in the matchday programme. i see no issue with this. 
Clearly I'm on my own here.. But don't see how a $5 program in the states has any relevance to a programme at Anfield. 

**************

TARGET WORD: snakes

*2011-13*
makes me feel much better, at least we dont have to deal with your...'spider/snakes/scorpians/EVERYTHING ALIVE' problem 
also hate stuff like snakes n that (not my snake tho)

*2017*
Can't compare snakes to people. 
Snakes FC
Im done with this motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane
snakes don't have legs. How can they play football.
But snakes don't have legs and seem to be pretty pricey.

**************

TARGET WORD: wholesome

*2011-13*
Well, it seems they have a more healthy and wholesome way of running a sportsteam

*2017*
That's dank m8. I would r8 it a wholesome 8/8. No h8
Wholesome Mohamed
He's a walking wholesome meme
The best and most wholesome gif
Aw, this was such a nice thing to read as soon as I opened the thread! You wholesome motherfucker
**************

TARGET WORD: clenched

*2011-13*
You can see that Carra is constipated. His fist is clenched and face is reddened.
He had a clenched fist and hit the guy, no sense in pretending it didn 't happen
I can honestly say I was already wondering how we were going to get that one goal lead back as Benteke took that shot. My arse clenched so tight...
Took a red card for new comments to arrive, the entire sub had our collective butts clenched it seems 
Just don't do it in the second half. He'll probably be clenched with fear.

*2017*
This is it. In my fuzzy weed memory he had clenched fists, but this works too
anus = clenched 
Then I want one with his fists clenched and his infamous snarl, Angry Klopp
Sitting at home, each and everyone of us have our butts clenched in the last minutes because we know what can and prob will happen
A clenched asshole has a few secrets but a prolapsed one has none.

**************

TARGET WORD: merchant

*2011-13*
Love it. And love him. Such a wee wind-up merchant and doesn't give a shit what anyone, other than Liverpool (and Uruguay) fans, think of him. 
Nah, it's good to see you here dude, especially since you're not a wind-up merchant like some other 'visitors' can be
However, I am pleased that King Kenny decided to sign a winger who creates chances rather than a typical speed merchant
Putting United at third is quite optimistic tbh, they will probably luck merchant another trophy. 
Windup merchant. No right foot. I jest.

*2017*
Unless it comes through the club store, we don't get anything and even then we just get the merchant cut
Pace is a must, but can't just be a pace merchant
He 's a bullshit merchant
Hes just another news aggregator merchant who links you to clickbaity articles pretending to be in the know
Hey I'm not suggesting they're not a dishonest, agenda-driven bog roll merchant. But so is literally every single other paper out there.

**************

TARGET WORD: darkness 

*2011-13*
Ok, so we tell Spurs and Dortmund we're in for Messi, just to keep those two unimaginative fuckers tied up for the summer, then we do our business under cover of darkness?
Under a secure blanket of darkness, the master ensures this his art will live on through another generation
It might be because there has been so much darkness, but wow, it's amazing how we played
We need some light on all the darkness surrounding us with the Suarez situation.
"You were supposed to bring bring balance to Liverpool, not leave it in darkness." No, I don 't think Liverpool is in darkness.

*2017*
*hello darkness my old friend*
Hello again Darkness I saw you just last week. :/
"Hello darkness my old friend"
I am the F5 in the darkness
Hello darkness Kevin Friend.... You've come to referee again...

**************

TARGET WORD: talents

*2011-13*
Because fuck we are Liverpool FC we make our own talents.
I agree entirely, it 's the draws with arsenal and City back to back away followed by a loss at home to West Brom, a team with no remarkable talents (no offense to West Brom)
FSG know they have to invest in the squad in order to succeed, and they are doing it nicely." JTG: "You 're right, all of Rodgers signings are world class, proven talents and will go on to lift champions leagues and premier leagues over a long illustrious career at Liverpool with Rodgers at the helm until he 's 80." Please stop being a jackass.
If he goes, get Alonso back. Improve the midfield and use some young talents up front.
Chelsea are due one too, with Lucas Piazon and other really really good talents being wasted because of the owner's demand for instant success

*2017*
he's one of the biggest goal keeping talents, with Lafont, Donnarumma, Rulli, Horn, Butland and Danny Ward. 
just curious, what are some worse talents that did well with sheet attitude and hard work
I think after all those years we should bring in more settled player than talents, if he is just an addition to another LB I am fine with it
Klopp is forming a team with alot of very young lads like TAA Woodburn and hopefully other talents to come and he cannot have players in this group that are a bad example for those kids in any form
If clubs like Barcalona, RM and Bayern are coming in for players, that means our business in the transfer market has been very successful and profitable, and our players are among the top talents in the world

**************

TARGET WORD: doubter

*2011-13*
He does look good, I was a bit of a silent doubter but you were right to believe it seems
I was initially a doubter and wanted him out, but has proven himself
Decided to do a comp on Henderson since I'm still a doubter
Hopefully, he'll keep proving doubter wrong over and over again in the coming few months
Any Pepe Reina doubter should show him the loyalty he did when he stayed with Liverpool

*2017*
Well, it's more Believer to doubter.
Status: Doubter
I went from doubter to believer back to doubter
I just want to believe...I don't want to be a fucking doubter
I was a doubter. Now I am a believer!

**************

TARGET WORD: explaining

*2011-13*
I don't know if I will be explaining this well but today felt to me like one of those games where even though we had so many chances none really felt like they were going in the net
I watch quite a lot of Sunderland matches (as you might have picked up from my previous posts) and I *think* I can go some way to explaining why Pepe's distribution stats are so much better
I 'm sorry I 'm not a homer or shill that agrees with everything my club does but you 've got a seriously distorted picture of my opinions anyhow, so I 'm not sure it 's worth explaining
Otherwise, that is quite a claim to make without evidence or at least an argument explaining why.
It's something I took special not of earlier because I was watching the 2 matches with friends and explaining how Brendan's style involves pressing as much as it does anything else, and contrasting that with how Laudrup has Swansea play, so it stood out to me later

*2017*
Nope, just explaining the downvotes for you. If anyone seems upset it's you.
I'm fairly happy with the turn out and it's been fun explaining the meaning to friends and family who visit
Umm I'm shit at explaining how to pronounce. But it's kind of like: Come-re am biff That's not exact but best I can explain in English.
I'm shocked that even needed explaining TBH but also it's completely irrelevant but it's not going to happen
Getting downvoted for explaining the logic lol .. I'll never understand reddit

**************

TARGET WORD: tapping

*2011-13*
Recalling the Manchester United game from last year, Kuyt scored three times by having excellent positioning and TAPPING in chances Suarez created
-Howard Webb and Stevie on a first name basis lol -Pablo TAPPING just under the Anfield sign -Swansea just honestly looked like a team walking out of the tunnel that was lucky to lose by 5
That is exactly why TAPPING up laws exist, and why most players (eg
But they did, apparently, trigger a different kind of clause that allows them to speak to the player without it being considered "TAPPING up"
While the TAPPING up rules are very strict, there is a non-enforcement agreement between most clubs

*2017*
Along with Barcelona doing their TAPPING up during the window too. Liverpool did theirs mid season.
.....I assume they have proof of TAPPING him up (Klopp meeting VVD etc.)
I love Klopp, but let's be honest, he's one of the responsible for the TAPPING fiasco.
I've heard it leaked that we were TAPPING the third kits up. Apparently they want the league to investigate
I 'm a firm believer that none of the nonsense with "TAPPING up" Van Dijk would have happened if it wasn 't for sources like the echo churning out content about it endlessly 

**************

TARGET WORD: advocate

*2011-13*
Devil's ADVOCATE a transfer request isn't what it seems, same went for Meireles
Also, (again playing Devil's ADVOCATE, not saying I want to sell him) selling Suarez for enough money to buy us two good wingers, two solid midfielders, and bench depth at one or two positions would be great for the team
Just to play Devil's ADVOCATE, our own Danny Sturridge is on fine form, will bring less drama, and would be cheaper too, 10 goals from 11 games. although unproven. 
Merely playing Devil's Advocate here but only because there's three teams worth mentioning in La Liga how would Messi do in the EPL
So until there is evidence to the contrary, it behooves me for the sake of conversation to play devil 's ADVOCATE.

*2017*
Playing devil's ADVOCATE here, but footballers are pretty much set for life, while a raise makes a big difference for us plebs.
Devil's ADVOCATE, you could turn it around and say it'd be 15 for Matip and 15 for _____ if we bought a 30m centre back.
Devil's ADVOCATE: it's commonly mentioned that after a serious injury (i.e
Not only does Klavan not read this shit on reddit, I love how you ADVOCATE for free will of supporters to not exist
Is Dick Advocaat a real Advocate though? Or is he like Mike Ross?

**************

TARGET WORD: tourists

*2011-13*
It does disappoint me to see that I struggle to get tickets for games that go to tourists and daytrippers Just think about it this way: They are OOTers who support the club too
Of course you get a pass! I'm sure the same rules apply when you hear American tourists in Australian
I've worked in shops when I was younger where he expected to be served first before tourists and would moan, swear and yell until he got his way
I put that down to the high prices of tickets that tend to go to wealthy tourists and corporate events/promotions
I 've no problem with tourists going to Anfield with their cameras, but believe me many many matchgoing reds do

*2017*
It's too many football tourists and people outside Liverpool coming in to slag people off
Getting the whole ground singing when most are tourists is fucking horrible. Edit: I love tourists. I'm basically one. But fuck me it kills the atmosphere.
There's less than 5% of tourists at football matches, I read somewhere
There is a lot of things to do here and quite a lot of tourists come in during the season (hiking, camping, stuff like that) beacuse our nature is so diverse
Weird how the Brits hate the tourists despite the fact that it's the tourists' money who save the club

**************

TARGET WORD: naked

*2011-13*
I'll be watching online. At home. In my apartment. Naked. Also expecting the hurricane
He could have been naked and we still wouldn't of noticed him
Except he's not naked, greased up, or deaf? For now...
I can't watch the match this week due to my laptop dying but I am lying naked in bed again!
You ever seen a grown man naked?

*2017*
Are your really naked if you have your socks on?
If the police are called because you're in public, you're probably naked
Oi. Watch it. I live in Canada. 10 degrees is naked beach weather
Hot weather..... half naked women everywhere.... clubs open till 6 am... why lol
A team of Firminos would be amazing, but a team of naked Firminos would be off the charts

**************

TARGET WORD: travel

*2011-13*
I live in Cambridge and regularly travel on the train (via London) to see family in Liverpool.
I always try, but they're always singles and I travel with at least 1 or 2 other fans
Looking at changing our travel plans to accommodate it
I didn't travel with a club, just a group of friends. I live in New Zealand.
Had Torres had the chance to travel back in time, would he have left Liverpool for Chelsea?

*2017*
A little lost trying to decide when to travel to see LFC and tickets
Southampton supports club or people that travel up to the match
Is it worth it to travel to Liverpool without a match ticket?
He apparently even offered himself to travel to Liverpool for a trial
Epsecially when our top players have to travel to Africa and South America.

**************

TARGET WORD: dilly

*2011-13*
He dilly dallys with the ball thinking what to do when he's in an attacking position
With him playing further back, the CBs can link up with him immediately, instead of dilly-daddling between the back four and the keeper
How did that go over my head? Haha dilly me. 
Compared to our recruitment team that dilly-dallied and almost always lost out
You're so dilly!

*2017*
Dilly fucking ding dilly dong, man 
dilly dilly
They score 1 cheap goal then dilly dally dick around for the remainder of the match..same old shite football..they 'll get found out big time playing higher quality teams.
Dilly ding dilly dong, we're in the Champions League, man!
I'd argue his distribution was actually really good weirdly enough. He found a teammate very often. His problem is he dilly dallied three times...Probably overconfident imo.

TARGET WORD: cooking

Middle of Nowhere, Illinois: My Parents ' Living Room -(5/10) open at all hours, but you have to book the television in advance, or else they will show stupid cooking shows
Go to What's Cooking and get an Olympic burger
I can vouch for What's Cooking, they make a tasty burger :) if you like a beer, check out the ship & mitre, they do a long list of different beers
Do you smell what the Cout is cooking?

*2017*
Tories have always seen the city of Liverpool like that last little bit of scum they can't quite manage to scrape off the cooking pot
Only results we have so far are pH, which was 5.5 in the streams directly beneath the landfill which is very low for drinking and cooking which is primarily what the populace in the area is using it for
They also made a few cooking videos(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch0GCDuJVZM) starring Mr Nasty.
Much better cooking on the fly.
She's cooking a dish called Scouse(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouse_ (food )), and Liverpudlians are also known as Scousers due to the strong association with this dish.

TARGET WORD: lean

*2011-13*
"I 'll make Player X LEAN on Player Y, who is LEANing on Brendan Rodgers, who is LEANing on a wall!"
If the priority is a long term overhaul with gradual improvements, then I LEAN more favourably towards Martinez, though wonder why we sacked Dalglish.
nPersonally, I'd lean towards Skrtel
I've definitely done this with my girlfriend... She has since learned not to lean against me during matches
I'm impressed how Suarez can LEAN so far :-|

*2017*
Prediction time: on what date are we going to see the first lean of the summer?
They take my Mané...FSG I'm in need...Please buy a winger...Somebody with speed...So make a signing... make a signing...Cuz I need a lean...
That is a fucking solid lean: 9/10
That might well be the best lean I've ever seen.
Coutinho Lean Hype!

**************

TARGET WORD: election

*2011-13*
The EGM will focus on the election of a board of directors by the members, and the direction of the club over the coming season
Given that today is election day in the states, can somebody find me one of the modified Gerrard or Suarez "HOPE" posters? 
But Perez has an election to contest and he may well use that in his campaign
They spend crazy money on election year

*2017*
The last time a party in the UK received a majority of the popular vote in a general election was in 1931
I honestly think both the brexit and trumps election goes to show people are sick of it all
I could give less of a toss about the validity of election results and whatever, I\'m literally challenging your assertion that that the majority of people\'s opinion leans towards Tory.
Idk about the other one but people bring up the election like it was some big upset but in reality 28% is not a very low probability
After the election news I'm just feeling jaded and I'd much rather just be angry again

**************

TARGET WORD: schedules

*2011-13*
I think Everton might due to lack of squad depth but despite harder schedules I struggle to find two of Spurs, Arsenal, and Chelsea conveniently slipping up enough for us to catch them
Time to check schedules..
Arsenal and Tottenham aren't playing great football at the moment either and we have had one of the toughest schedules so far this year
He stated in an interview that he wants to give a lot of his time to his wife and family who have been so patient with the football schedules over the years
To be honest though my only gripes with the MLS are the schedules where you can either play a team 3 times or only once, and the weird ability to transfer in and out almost completely at random.

*2017*
And if not changes to the squad, then at least changes to the way we play during congested fixture schedules
United and City had the easiest schedules in the entire league
Especially ManU and Chelsea schedules look brutal
Our schedules just conflicted so much and it was too difficult to keep it going as a serious relationship after a truly magical first few months last winter
It also looks like they have the harder of the three remaining schedules between us, arsenal and them

**************

TARGET WORD: owls

Good owls

*2017*
To be honest, after the complaints about last year and the owls, we won't be doing anything this year
I love all you guys. Particularly you plastic. Excellent work with the owls
M8 owls was the shit
A perverse sexual desire for owls?

TARGET WORD: narrative

*2011-13*
My main gripe with him is that doesn't understand modern football, so he just goes after the morality narrative, or wherever he can find conflict
"The so-called 'quality ' newspapers in England," Dean said, "didn 't seem interested in the aspects of Suarez 's background, which contradicted their own simplistic narrative ..
The media should not play along with it just because it also fits their narrative of Suarez as an arch villain of the league
Of course, no one cares because it doesn't fit their narrative.
Because the media needs a good narrative

*2017*
I agree that proxy support (banking, finding, suppliers, etc) for these enterprises (like palm oil, fracking, etc) easily turns into a straw man / ad hominem narrative, but theses are the pressures that build importance for having conversation, agreement, and ultimately, enforcable limits
I'm sick and tired of this narrative that Liverpool are just utter shite at defending
Yeah as much as I enjoy United supporters eating their words I don't really buy into the *he's shite* narrative, I bet if he went here instead of United he'd have blossomed instead of stagnating.
Now that the season is over, it definitely feels like it follows the narrative of United fans
Watch how the narrative will change if he has a bad game

**************

TARGET WORD: bait

*2011-13*
We could use Coutinho as bait.
Whereas the sun and the mail are ran by cunts for cunts and I don't want them getting any ad hits from people here falling for the bait.
Coates could maybe be used as bait for another CB (such as the Nastasic deal for City where Savic went to Fiorentina)
It's nothing but site bait
like to bait people so it looks like im totally committing to his right foot, then swing it around and fire it with his left

*2017*
My issue isn't that it's on Twitter. It's that Anfield HQ bait people quite often. Like right now. Their tweets are usually misleading on purpose. 
Would be helpful if the whole article was posted so the context could be seen. These kind of click bait twitter posts should be banned.
Might as well fuck them over by giving Moreno to PSG on a cut price just to bait Coutinho there.
I would be happy if it 's true, but transfer news has been slow around liverpool so it 's probably click bait
Why the hell are you all taking the bait so hard?

**************

TARGET WORD: africans

*2011-13*
and also adebayor would be leaving for the Africans cup of nations in January and that only leaves the spurs with one senior striker
Toure has the legs for anything mate. He would do well anywhere you put him on the pitch. Africans, man...
Wenger's magic only works on French-speaking West Africans.
especially from Africa...we have no players africans can relate to
I'm sure there's more than two south Africans. 

*2017*
I'm not sure about the Africans, hopefully they're content with not living in a third world country
You are confusing prejudice for racism here though, aren't you? All Africans live in villages is the exact same to all Eastern Siberians live in a frozen wasteland. 
Note to rich Europeans, if you're going to get annoyed at Africans or other non-Westerners (and you have the right to if those individuals are being irritating), at least try not to sound like some pith-helmeted imperial administrator from the 1890s
There is a consistent and long standing stereotype of Africans that they come from tribal villages
Also just like to note we have a few other Africans in the team.

TARGET WORD: determine

Re: Sahin Rodgers saying in a Soccernet.com article(http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/1176796/nuri-sahin 's-liverpool-future-uncertain,-says-brendan-rodgers?cc=5901): >"I don 't look beyond the loan period because there are lots of things which will determine whether he ever came here (permanently)," said the Reds boss
Its our ability to score goals that will determine our future.
Because basically it 's using statistics to determine what the best players are
Merseyside Derby Day decider Saturday's game to determine whether baby is a Blue or a Red
After the denial, a bunch of random people decide the quote is fake and somehow determine it to be coming from Arsenal supporters (this part I 'm still fuzzy onwhat does any of this have to do with Arsenal?), but now it looks like maybe it isn 't fake after all and the retraction to the retraction to the retraction to the retraction is perhaps correct after all in that he still wants to leave

*2017*
At the end of the day, the players we have determine the success of the club through their actions on the pitch
Sturridge had a scan when he returned to Merseyside to determine how much damage was done but it was more a fatigue issue and assuming there are no more problems, the England striker could be involved in full training tomorrow
Just needs more time so we can determine whether it's his game or just a lack of confidence
He would bring that information to somebody who will calculate: *Will we loose money from the 'negative publicity'?* The answer to this question will determine if whoever takes offense in a particular sponsorship will be able to change the fact (the two factors are: significance in numbers (and or impact) and credibility of expected loss in future income)
Just a heads up we can't have any of the below results happen on Sunday or we play Arsenal or City in a 39th game on a neutral ground to determine CL

TARGET WORD: spicy

*2011-13*
And as a Norwegian that came over here thinking that black pepper was spicy, the food those cultures bring with them are just awesome
they'll continuously prank you with very obvious pranks like adding words to your staff notes like 'spicy sausage rodgers' or sending him texts with my phone like 'did it hurt when you fell from heaven'
If you haven't been on the Anfield stadium tour, and musem(http://www.liverpoolfc.com/history/tour-and-museum/home) I can highly recommend it! Nando's is a nice lunch place if you like spicy food as well.
oh absolutely! if were alive and kicking then by all means bring on the kids, but the last thing we want to do is get spicy and daring and throw the kids in to drown against a team like spurs.

*2017*
So it's still relevant. Cuz he's spicy 🌶 
I'm expecting spicy memes about the spice boys era kit.
That's a spicy summer meatball on the horizon.
Young spicy shit 🌶️🌶️🔥🔥
I've spent all afternoon making some spicy ones for the new season

**************

TARGET WORD: vans

*2011-13*
A most excellent atmosphere, although it's usually six deep at the bar! And there are plenty of chippies / burger vans around the ground
Yea, i live half an hour away from liverpool, its the part that separates Liverpool and Manchester (Warrington), thats the biggest rivalry around here riot vans in the town centre for anything that might happen on match day.
The food in the stadium is expensive, but there are tons of takeaways/burger vans outside which are cheaper
I loved my vans rowley xlt's in high school, extra fond of them now haha

*2017*
2 Vans 1 Dijk
Vans come and vans go, but Kolo is forever
I'm sleeping with my Dijk out tonight and having wet dreams about Mercedes Vans.
Rumour has it Van Djik was wearing these vans in the van.
Hahah I love it. Anything with vans is instant karma!

**************

TARGET WORD: tracking

*2011-13*
Definitely, but I'm guessing they have some sort of IP tracking system that'll inform them when multiple address's are logging into an account from different areas
Stoke are pretty incapable of tracking defenders running forward and the more we do it the better we look.
the first 2 goals actually come from Gerrard letting a man run off him and not tracking him
as we were getting blown up from midfielders not tracking back. 
The same thing happens with Barcelona, but they have their wingers run in behind, into the space vacated by the CBs tracking Messi

*2017*
Klopp would be tearing his hair out watching his lazy attempts at pressing and tracking back
Then we can't do the flight tracking
I wish we could do the plane tracking thing or something crazy like that again.
Great tracking back Can
Don't worry we're all working on bringing our boy to Anfield tracking this flight

**************

TARGET WORD: believers

*2011-13*
Someone who invests his heart and soul, and drags the disBELIEVERS with the believers, kicking and screaming to the top of the mountain once more
Militant atheists are as annoying as the most preachy of believers
Woohoo joe Allen believers from day one. Haters gonna hate. Can't wait to see more of him paired with Lucas. He'll be able to go farther up the pitch!

*2017*
Klopp said we had to turn from doubters to believers and it just hasn't happened yet.
Man United dropped 2 points so we're still only 3 points off the top. Lets stay as believers people!
To be cliché, doubters to believers.
Doubters to believers my friends....3-1 Reds
just when I thought Klopp had turned the doubters into believers

**************

TARGET WORD: select

*2011-13*
The pictures they select are often ridiculous and how Harry Harris still has a job is beyond me.
I 've found how to get it: Click the drop down arrow next to other calendars again -> "Browse interesting calendars" -> select the sports tab at the top -> Soccer -> English Premier League -> Liverpool "Subscribe" that should work better
The only problem i have with that survey is that i NEED to select an LFC man of the match
Teams have to start designing jerseys almost a full year ahead of time in order to work through all the designs/ideas, finally select the 1-3, choose fabrics, get prototypes/samples, tweak, and finally send to production in order to have them out by the early-mid summer
At least select Kevin Bacon or someone of similar ilk

*2017*
If Liverpool Airport is the same there'd be a select few private hire companies able to do this....assuming it's not the airports own VIP car
It's not a select few local's club, it's OUR club
When you signup for the iOS app, you are given the choice to select categories you are interested in
He walked out of the stadium when Brendan didn't select him for one of the Merseyside derbies I think
There's a select group of clubs ahead of LFC and turning them down is extremely hard

**************

TARGET WORD: pharaoh

*2011-13*
pharaoh didn't rate Moses 
and the pharaoh died of aids

*2017*
Liverpool's pharaoh!!!!!
Thought Mo only has 4 ... but either way I can see him Bagging somewhere around 19-22 range. Bless our pharaoh. 
So glad the Egyptian Pharaoh is back ;)
Perfect response by our pharaoh
The pharaoh and the Piranha

**************

TARGET WORD: verify

*2011-13*
As I said, don 't bet the mortgage, but that 09-10 Tottenham team still finished top 4 (and I don 't believe they were expected to do that, but I 'd have to verify)
i saw this article on espnfc and came here to verify, but i don't see any sources or quotes in either
Can anyone verify this to be true?
Can somebody verify.
I was saying the English FA needs to verify the validity of the charge and sentence from a foreign league if it is to be used against someone as a prior offense

*2017*
Given that even Joyce takes the Guinean media as a credible source to verify the stance/rhetoric coming out of the player's camp, they're the ones of note to keep an eye on since only their situation's fluid enough to have a change that will be significant enough to affect the overall picture
Could someone verify me for the FIFA tournament? My discord name is JLEC VICTORY. Thanks
Apologies. Went to Wikipedia before posting to verify what I was thinking and clearly my reading comprehension is lacking. Something something American education. ¯ _(ツ)_/¯
ajbns87 (verify please)
They're nearly all lumped into the same bracket as overrated and torn down at the first possible chance to verify that opinion

**************

TARGET WORD: madman

*2011-13*
Additionally, Villas-Boas not only had several huge egos in the dressing room, he also had a madman breathing down his neck.
Jump around like a madman during the match when we score, and then at the final whistle, while everyone else is going mental, jumping up and down and celebrating, I'll just sink to my knees and cry my eyes out
I'm picturing Levy browsing this sub, cackling like a madman, and googling any names he comes across. 
who was the madman....John Terry or Abramovich?....I think given time he could do well at liverpool.
wtf so days mean millions now? ok I'am out go nuts Mr. madman

*2017*
Oh Jesus. This made me laugh like a madman.
But he really kept his word, the madman
1. Love me some Gini. 2. I hope Couts never leaves us for Barca. 3. Moreno is a madman. 4. Liverpool.
He actually did it the absolute madman!!
He turned it 180 the madman. Everyone is tier 0 now

**************

TARGET WORD: discord

*2011-13*
Bringing in a keeper that could walk right in would be a slap in the face to Reina, one of the most loyal and reliable Reds we've had in years, and would create a serious amount of discord in the dressing room, ignoring the fact that Reina a fucking world class keeper is the least of our concerns when you look at the squad as a whole
The media will scrutinise every single word Dalglish says, trying to find any source of discord between the "Director" and the manager
They also had clubhouse discord last season that led to a team collapse after being the best team in baseball for the middle four months of the season

*2017*
I'll do my best to find you one. Last time everyone found a partner find. People without them just got on early on discord and found one that way. 
Come to discord(https://DISCORDapp.com/channels/298181445334073368/298181445334073368)
Was that how all these images have been organised? Via discord?
1) discord username: gouser 2) Preferred nickname: gouser
Cheers lad, tried to get onto your discord so we could share our plans and check everything was sweet on your end but the link wont work for me

**************

TARGET WORD: passengers

*2011-13*
Allen and Henderson IMO are both passengers in a midfield--you can't rely on them to bring the play forward
I call it the Spruce Moose! And it will carry 200 passengers from New York's idlewild airport to the Belgian Congo in 17 minutes!
Oh yeah...getting into CL as mere passengers is no good...we definitely want to compete for it
None of our midfielders are passengers, but all do have deficits that need to be accommodated

*2017*
"Salah was sitting alone wearing a black "jacket" and black glasses so that passengers would not recognize him as per instructions from Liverpool officials." That is protocol definitely left over from Ayre
CAPTAIN WE ARE LOW ON COAL BUT THE passengers ARE VOLUNTEERING AS ~~TRIBUTE~~ FUEL
We can't really afford to have passengers in the team, that's why Gini and Can really need to..
We have no time for passengers today and Origi has been in dreadful form
My main problem was that the tram can 't just drive off like nothing happened, so me and the other passengers had to leg it through the snow
